My name is Manoj M
I am a devil of my word
I make a deal I keep a deal
I am not sad, I'm freaking hungry.
You have my word on that. 
I know that you are obssessed with me.
I am manoj 
I am Wolverine.
I'm Elijah
I have to become someone else I have to become something else
So long as Malcolm Merlyn is in my city, the leaque will make no move on him. He's under my protection.
